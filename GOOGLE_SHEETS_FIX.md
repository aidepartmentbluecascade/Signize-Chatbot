# Google Sheets Continuous Update Fix

## Problem Description

The chat was not being continuously updated to Google Sheets because of a variable scope issue between `app.py` and `session_manager.py`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Variable Scope Issue**: `saved_sessions` was defined in `app.py` but `session_manager.py` couldn't access it
2. **Missing Global Declaration**: The session manager was trying to access an undefined variable
3. **Update Logic Failure**: When checking `if session_id in saved_sessions`, it was checking against an undefined variable
4. **No Continuous Updates**: Only the first message was being saved to Google Sheets

## Root Cause

The `saved_sessions` set was defined in `app.py` but `session_manager.py` was trying to access it without proper sharing between modules. This caused the update logic to fail, preventing continuous updates to Google Sheets.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Global Variable Management

Added proper global variable management in `session_manager.py`:

```python
# Global variable to track saved sessions
saved_sessions = set()

def set_saved_sessions(sessions_set):
    """Set the global saved_sessions from app.py"""
    global saved_sessions
    saved_sessions = sessions_set

def get_saved_sessions():
    """Get the current saved_sessions set"""
    global saved_sessions
    return saved_sessions
```

### 2. Module Synchronization

Updated `app.py` to properly sync the `saved_sessions` with the session manager:

```python
from session_manager.session_manager import save_session_to_sheets, set_saved_sessions, get_saved_sessions

# In-memory storage for chat sessions
chat_sessions = {}
saved_sessions = set()

# Initialize session manager with saved_sessions
set_saved_sessions(saved_sessions)
```

### 3. Continuous Update Logic

Enhanced the update logic to properly sync after each Google Sheets operation:

```python
if success and session_id not in saved_sessions:
    saved_sessions.add(session_id)
    set_saved_sessions(saved_sessions)  # Sync with session_manager
    print(f"✅ Session {session_id} added to saved_sessions")
elif success:
    print(f"✅ Session {session_id} updated in Google Sheets")
```

## How It Works Now

1. **First Message**: Creates a new row in Google Sheets and adds session_id to saved_sessions
2. **Subsequent Messages**: Updates the existing row with new messages and maintains session tracking
3. **Continuous Updates**: Each new message triggers an update to the Google Sheets row
4. **Session Persistence**: The saved_sessions set is properly maintained across module boundaries

## Testing

Use the `test_google_sheets_update.py` script to verify that:
- First message creates a new row in Google Sheets
- Subsequent messages update the existing row
- Session tracking works properly across multiple messages

## Files Modified

- `app.py`: Added proper module synchronization
- `session_manager/session_manager.py`: Added global variable management
- `test_google_sheets_update.py`: New test script for verification

## Expected Behavior

After this fix, each chat message should:
1. ✅ Be processed by the AI
2. ✅ Be saved to MongoDB
3. ✅ Update Google Sheets (either new row or existing row)
4. ✅ Maintain proper session tracking
5. ✅ Work continuously for the entire conversation
