# Session Consolidation Fix

## Overview
This document describes the fixes implemented to resolve database duplication and HubSpot conversation fragmentation issues.

## Problems Solved

### 1. Database Duplication
**Issue**: The system was creating new MongoDB documents for the same email across different sessions, leading to fragmented data.

**Solution**: Modified `mongodb_operations.py` to use email as the primary key for sessions, merging messages for existing emails.

### 2. HubSpot Conversation Fragmentation
**Issue**: HubSpot contact IDs were tied to `session_id` instead of `email`, and conversations were being overwritten instead of appended.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `app.py` to use email-based HubSpot contact management
- Modified `hubspot/hubspot.py` to implement append functionality
- Fixed property name to use `chatbot_conversation` (lowercase with underscores)

## Key Changes

### MongoDB Operations (`mongodb_operations.py`)
- Modified `save_chat_session` to use email as primary key
- Added `get_chat_session_by_email` function
- Added `update_hubspot_contact_id_by_email` and `update_hubspot_last_sync_by_email` functions

### HubSpot Integration (`hubspot/hubspot.py`)
- **Fixed Property Name**: Changed from "Chatbot Conversation" to `chatbot_conversation` (lowercase with underscores)
- **Added Append Mode**: `hubspot_patch_conversation` now supports `append_mode=True`
- **Explicit Property Requests**: Modified GET requests to explicitly request `chatbot_conversation` property
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error messages for missing properties

### Main Application (`app.py`)
- Updated HubSpot contact management to use email-based retrieval
- Modified sync logic to use `append_mode=True` for conversation updates
- Added fallback logic for missing HubSpot properties

## HubSpot Property Configuration
The system now correctly uses the `chatbot_conversation` property in HubSpot:
- **Property Name**: `chatbot_conversation` (lowercase with underscores)
- **Field Type**: Multi-line text
- **Object Type**: Contact
- **Group**: contactinformation

## Migration
A migration script (`migrate_sessions.py`) is available to consolidate existing duplicate sessions in MongoDB.

## Testing
The HubSpot conversation append functionality has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Property retrieval works correctly
- ✅ Append mode preserves existing conversations
- ✅ No data overwriting occurs
- ✅ Proper error handling for missing properties

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
All issues have been successfully resolved. The system now:
- Consolidates sessions by email in MongoDB
- Appends conversations to HubSpot instead of overwriting
- Uses the correct HubSpot property name
- Maintains conversation history across sessions
