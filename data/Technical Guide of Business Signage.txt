3D Signs
3D Signs refers to signs that have depth and dimensionality, typically created by constructing individual letters, logos, or elements with raised profiles. Unlike flat or printed signs, 3D signs physically project from their mounting surface, creating visual depth and shadow effects that enhance visibility, especially from different angles or under various lighting conditions. These signs can be fabricated They are typically fabricated using materials such as aluminum, stainless steel, acrylic, wood, or a combination of these. Depending on the design, 3D signs can be illuminated (front-lit, backlit, or side-lit) or non-illuminated.
Channel letters are three-dimensional letters that are built like hollow boxes. Each letter has a front, side walls (called returns), and often a back, creating an internal space known as a “channel.” That’s where the name comes from. In illuminated signs, this channel is used to hold lighting components like LEDs. But even if there's no lighting involved, the construction style stays the same — the letters are still formed with depth and structure, giving them a bold, professional look.
Types of Signs are 3D Metal Signs (available in non-lit and back-lit channel letters), 3D Acrylic Signs (with front-lit, back-lit, side-lit, and non-lit options), 3D Wood Signs, 3D Metal on Acrylic Signs, Flat Cut 2D Signs, Cabinet Signs such as Push-Thru and LightBox styles, vibrant UV Printed Acrylic Signs, and high-visibility Blade Signs / 2D Blade Signs

Common Issues
Sign Does Not Illuminate or Flickers During Operation
The lighting within the sign blinks or flickers intermittently, potentially due to unstable power input, loose wiring, or a faulty LED driver.
The signage does not illuminate when connected to the power source. This may indicate an issue with the power supply, wiring, or internal components.
Step 1: Check the Power Supply
Before connecting to your signage, verify proper voltage output using one of the following methods:
Option	Step	Details
1. Multimeter Test	1. Set the multimeter to DC voltage (20V)	
	2. Connect probes	Red probe → DC (+) and Black probe → DC (–)
	3. Expected reading	12V ± 0.5V
2. Voltage Tester	1. Hold the tester near the DC output wires	
	2. Indicators	Light or beep → Power detected. 
If No signal → Recheck input power or wiring
3. Channel Letter Test (Direct)	1. Isolate one channel letter	
	2. Connect temporarily	One wire to DC (+) and One wire to DC (–)
	3. If light turns ON	Power supply is working
	4. If light does not turn ON	Reverse polarity by reconnecting the wires in an alternate sequence
Step 2: Identifying Wiring Colors
DC Output Wires:
White, Red or Any Other Colored Wire = Positive (+)
Black = Negative (–)
⚠ If the letter does not light up, reverse the DC wires and test again.
Step 3: Connecting Letters to Power Supply
⚡ Use Both Output Channels to Balance Load
Example Split:
Letters 1–4 → Output 1
Letters 5–8 → Output 2
Wiring Instructions:
Bundle all positive wires from each group → Connect to White, Red or any other color (+) output wire.
Bundle all negative wires from each group → Connect to Black (–) output wire.
Ensure all connections are:
Securely tightened
Properly insulated
Turn on AC power and confirm all letters illuminate.
Electrical Connection Diagram
Below are some examples of electrical connection diagrams, including wire connections and load management. Depending on the signage, the setup may use one or two junctions, varying configurations accordingly.
If the power supply includes two output junctions, both may be utilized; however, if the sign operates reliably with a single junction, using one is sufficient. To ensure proper understanding of power distribution and load management, it is strongly recommended to provide the relevant electrical schematic for the specific sign. If this drawing is not readily available, the production team should be requested to prepare and supply one.
