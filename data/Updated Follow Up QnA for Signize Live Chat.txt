Proposal & Email Issues
Q: I didn’t receive the proposal email.
A: Please check your Spam, Junk, or Promotions folder in case it landed there. If you still don’t see it, I can resend the proposal to the same email or to an alternative email/WhatsApp if you prefer.
Q: The proposal email bounced back.
A: Could you please provide us with another email address? If it’s easier, we can also share the proposal via WhatsApp.
Q: I can’t see the pricing on the proposal.
A: The pricing is displayed on the right-hand side of the proposal PDF. If you’re viewing it on your phone, sometimes the file zooms in and cuts off that section. Would you like me to explain the pricing to you right now?
Q: I can’t see the size/dimensions on the proposal.
A: The sizes are listed in the proposal under the options section. If you’d like, I can guide you to that part or explain the available sizes here.
Q: The proposal only shows small/medium/large sizes. Are those the only options?
A: Not at all! Those are just sample options. We can create any custom size you want.

Design & Mockups
Q: I don’t like the design/mockup.
A: Thank you for sharing your feedback. Could you please tell us what you’d like to change? We’ll request a free revision from our design team.
Q: My landlord/boss has specific requirements for the sign.
A: Please share those requirements with us—either by email or here on the call—and we’ll revise your proposal accordingly.

Pricing & Discounts
Q: The price seems high. Can you do better?
A: We want to make sure you’re comfortable with your purchase. I can offer you a special one-time discount code to use at checkout.
Q: Even with a discount, I’m not satisfied with the price.
A: Could you let us know your budget range? We can create a revised proposal with options closer to your range.
Q: Do you offer discounts for multiple signs?
A: Yes, we offer special discounts when multiple signs are ordered together.
Q: I found a local option that’s cheaper. Why are you more expensive?
A: We totally understand price matters. Our signs are made with premium materials, free shipping, faster turnaround, and a 2-year warranty. We don’t compromise on quality. To make this easier, I can also offer you an additional discount.

Payment & Financing
Q: How do I proceed if I want to place an order?
A: Simply click the PDF proposal or payment link in your email, choose your preferred size and type, and proceed to checkout.
Q: What payment options do you offer?
A: You can pay directly through the checkout link. We accept credit card, ShopPay installments, wire transfer, and ACH payments.
Q: Do you offer financing/payment plans?
A: Yes, we offer flexible payment plans through ShopPay/Klarna. Options include 3 months, 6 months, or up to 1 year. We also offer split payments like 50-50 or 30-70.
Q: Can I pay in person at your office?

Shipping & Delivery
Q: What is the shipping cost?
A: Shipping is free anywhere in the USA.
Q: How long does delivery take?
A: Standard turnaround is 15–17 business days. If permitting is required, it can add an extra 2–4 weeks before production starts.

Q: Which courier services do you use?
A: We primarily ship with DHL and FedEx.

Installation & Permits
Q: Is installation included in the proposal?
A: Installation is not included by default. We can provide you with an installation quote upon request.
Q: Do I need to apply for the city permit myself?
A: No, we can handle the permit process for you. If you’d like a permit quote, just let us know.
Q: Why are permits and installation so expensive compared to the sign?
A: These services are handled through licensed third-party providers. Costs include travel, fuel, meals, and sometimes heavy machinery depending on the project size.
Q: Do you provide installation everywhere?
A: We currently do not offer installation in New York, California, or New Mexico. For other states, please share your full address so we can confirm availability.
Q: Do you also remove old signs?
A: Yes, we can remove existing signs if requested. This comes at an additional cost, which we’ll include in your final quotation.
Q: Do you send your own team for installation?
A: We work with trusted associate installers across the country. Please share your address so we can check availability in your area.
Q: Do you come in person to take measurements?
A: We can arrange site visits for measurements in selected locations. This involves an additional cost as part of our survey service.
Q: Can I get only a permit or only installation without the other?
A: Unfortunately, we can’t offer them separately since they’re handled through third parties. We keep them bundled for smooth coordination.

Technical & Product Details
Q: What materials are used for a 3D metal backlit sign?
A: These are made with stainless steel 304, around 1.5 inches thick, and produce a halo backlit effect.
Q: How does installation work for 3D metal backlit signs?
A: They require access behind the wall for wiring, since letters are installed individually. If wall access isn’t available, a backerboard can be used instead.
Q: Where are your signs manufactured?
A: Depending on the type, they are manufactured in the USA, Pakistan, or overseas facilities.
Q: What is the warranty on the sign?
A: All our signs come with a 2–3 year warranty.

Taxes, Refunds & Policies
Q: Do nonprofits get a tax exemption?
A: Unfortunately, taxes are government-mandated and can’t be removed. However, our pricing is already competitively discounted.
Q: Is tax included in the total price?
A: Yes, taxes are included as per standard billing.
Q: What is your refund policy?
A: If your sign is damaged during shipping, we’ll issue a full refund or replace it at no additional cost.
Q: What if I don’t like the sign once I receive it?
A: We’ll share real-time images for approval before shipping. We also allow last-minute design changes before production.

Call Handling & Follow-Ups
Q: I’m busy right now, can we talk later?
A: Absolutely. What’s a convenient time for me to follow up with you?
Q: I already submitted your proposal for approval.
A: Great! When would be a good time for me to follow up with you for feedback?
Q: I want to discuss this with my partner/manager/spouse first.
A: Sure, please take your time. Would you like me to check back in a few days?
