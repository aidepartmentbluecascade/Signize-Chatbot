A: Please check your Spam, Promotions, or Junk folder. If you still don't see it, we can resend 
the proposal on your email.
Q: The email bounced back. What should I do? 
A: Kindly provide another email address, preferably a personal one.
Q: I can't see the attachment or proposal details. 
A: We can resend the attachment or share the direct proposal link again.
 
Pricing, Discounts & Payments
Q: I don't see the pricing clearly on the proposal. 
A: The pricing is listed on the right-hand side of the PDF. If you're viewing on mobile and it 
looks zoomed in, let us know-we'll guide you or explain it on call.
Q: The price seems too high. Can I get a discount? 
A: Please let us know your budget range and we'll create revised options for you. 
Q: Do you offer payment plans? 
A: Yes, we offer flexible payment plans via ShopPay/Klarna, or split payments (50-50 or 30-70). 
Wire transfer and ACH are also available.
Q: What if I can't pay the full amount right now? 
A: You can choose ShopPay installments or one of our split-payment options.
 
 Shipping & Delivery
Q: Where do you ship from? Is it from China? 
A: No, we do not ship from China. We have multiple production facilities overseas, and 
shipments are handled via DHL and FedEx.
Q: How much is shipping? 
A: Shipping is free across the USA.
Q: How long does delivery take? 
A: Standard turnaround time is 2 weeks. If permitting is required, please allow additional time 
for that. For permits and installations, our team can provide you the right ETA.
 
Installation & Permit
Q: Is installation included in the price? 
A: Installation is not included but can be quoted on demand. Please share your address where the 
sign will be installed for a customized installation quote. Note: we currently do not cover 
California, New York, or New Mexico.
Q: Why does permit/installation cost more than the sign? 
A: These services are handled by licensed third-party providers. Costs include permits, travel, 
labor, heavy machinery (if needed), and insurance, which add to the overall price.
Q: Can I get only permit or only installation service? 
A: Unfortunately, we only provide them together to ensure smooth coordination.
Q: Do you also remove old signs? 
A: Yes, we can remove existing signs as part of installation services (extra charges apply).
Q: Do you visit the site to take measurements? 
A: Yes, we offer site surveys in select locations for an additional fee.
 
Design & Mockups
Q: I'm not happy with the design/mockup. Can I request changes? 
A: Absolutely! Let us know your feedback and we'll provide free revisions until you're satisfied.
Q: I'm confused by the different options in the proposal. Can you explain? 
A: Of course-we'll clarify the differences in types, pricing, and sizing. Would you like me to 
have one of our representatives call you back and assist you?
Q: I only see Small/Medium/Large sizes. Can you do custom sizes? 
A: Yes, we can make any custom size you need-just let us know.
 
Materials & Specifications
Q: Which material is best for hot weather? 
A: Metal signs (especially aluminum) are most heat-resistant and lightweight. Acrylic is also 
durable but better suited for normal conditions.
Q: What material is used in a 3D backlit sign? 
A: We typically use Stainless Steel 304. These signs are about 1.5 inches thick and give a halo 
backlit effect.
Q: How does installation work for 3D backlit signs? 
A: These require access behind the wall for wiring. If that's not possible, a backerboard can be 
added.
 
Company & Operations
Q: Where is your company based? 
A: Our headquarters is in New York, but we operate globally and have teams across multiple 
regions.
Q: Why are you calling from a different state number? 
A: We are a global business, and use multiple regional numbers to reach customers more 
efficiently.
Q: Do you have a physical office I can visit or pay at? 
A: Currently, we don't offer walk-in visits, but we can arrange management meetings upon 
request.

A: We're located at 809A Elmont Rd, Elmont, New York 11003-4035.

A: +1 9146037606,
 
Taxes & Policies

already discounted.

A: Yes, taxes are added to the total at checkout as per standard billing laws.
Q: What's your warranty policy? 
A: Our signs come with a 2-3 year warranty depending on the type.

Sales & Follow-ups

A: Of course, please take your time. When would be a good time for us to follow up?
Q: I need the sign sooner than your timeline. Can you rush it?
